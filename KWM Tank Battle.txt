Kevin Moore "Tank Battle" individual state rules and behaviors.


"Scan" State:

Spins the Turret around pulling from tacticoolData to find a target.
If a target is found, The Cannon State changes to the "Fire" state.


"Fire" State:

Halts all movement for a moment with the "cStop" state, double checks that the target is inSight.
Adjust the Cannon's aim with the "cRight" and "cLeft" states then fires.
If the target becomes out of sight or moves to far away the cannon state 
reverts back to the "Scan" state.


"cRight" State:

Reverts back to the "Scan" and "Scout" States if target is not inSight.

"cLeft" State:

Turns the cannon left is the target is to the left.
Reverts back to the "Scan" and "Scout" States if target is not inSight.

"cStop" State:

Halts cannon movement and if inSight is true, changes to the "Fire" State.
Otherwise it changes to the "Scout" State.


"Scout" state:

Picks a random target location and moves to that location. Uses Current 
and Previous states to determine if an obstacle has been reached and 
changes the the "Reverse" state. Also if the current health is less than
the previous health which means the tank took damage, it changes to the 
"Reverse" state.

"Forward" State:

Moves forward and changes to "Reverse" if and obstacle has been reached.
Then reverts back to the "Scout" state.


"Right" state:

Turns the tank right, and reverts to the "Scout" state.

"Left" state:

Turns the tank Left, and reverts to the "Scout" state.

"Reverse" State:

Puts the tank in reverse, and checks to make sure that it has cleared 
the obstacle. If it has, reverts the the "Scout" and "Scan" states.

"tStop"

Stops the tank to prepare for attacking. If the target has left sight
or the distance is greater that the cannon's range, it reverts to 
"Scout" and "Scan" states.
